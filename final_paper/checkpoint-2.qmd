title: "Checkpoint 2: Outline"
subtitle: Due Monday October 7 at noon

---


#### Objective
The goal of this checkpoint is to help you decide which paper you will write about and create a detailed outline of your *News & Views* article. 

#### Tasks

1. **Select One Paper**: From the three papers you previously chose, select the one you will focus on for your final *News & Views* article. Consider which paper has the most compelling findings or broader implications, which is most interesting to you, and which one you feel confident about explaining clearly to a general audience.

2. **Create an Outline**: Your outline should break down the structure of your *News & Views* article, guiding you through the main points you’ll need to cover. Use the following structure:
   - **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the broader topic or context. Explain why this research is important in a way that would catch the attention of a general, non-specialist audience. Set up the key question or problem that the paper addresses.
   - **Summary of Key Findings**: Summarize the research paper’s main findings clearly and concisely. Make sure your summary simplifies complex ideas without oversimplifying the science. Highlight the most interesting or surprising aspects of the research. Aim to avoid jargon and ensure that a general audience can follow along.
   - **Broader Implications**: Connect the research to a larger context. How does this study affect the field or even society at large? Mention any questions this research raises for future work or practical applications. Be sure to keep the tone accessible but insightful—this is where you can really engage readers with the broader significance.
   - **Conclusion**: Wrap up the article by reflecting on the importance of the research. Leave the reader with a sense of why this research matters in the bigger picture. You could include a forward-looking statement, such as potential future developments or questions left to be answered.

3. **Emphasizing *News & Views* Style**:
   - **Clarity**: Your outline should show how you plan to write in a clear and engaging way for non-experts. Avoid heavy technical details, but don’t shy away from highlighting exciting or impactful aspects of the work.
   - **Balanced Depth**: While writing for accessibility, also maintain depth by emphasizing the research’s significance and the connections to bigger questions.
   - **Engagement**: Think about how to keep readers interested throughout. You might include a surprising fact, real-world relevance, or something to spark curiosity.

#### Submission and evaluation

- **Submission** : Submit your completed outline in PDF format. Ensure that each section (Introduction, Summary, Broader Implications, Conclusion) is clearly labeled.
  
- **Evaluation**: In checkpoint 3, your peers will review your outline with the following in mind:
    - Have you chosen a paper that has both interesting findings and broader significance?
    - Does the outline of your introduction show how you will hook a general audience while introducing the research?
    - Does your outline indicate a clear and concise summary of findings, with complex ideas simplified?
    - Does you outline include how you will highlight the broader implications effectively?
    - Does the outline of your conclusion tie everything together and leave the reader with a sense of importance?
