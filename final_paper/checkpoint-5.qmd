title: "Checkpoint 4: Paper draft"
subtitle: Due Monday Nov 18 at noon

---

#### Objective:
The goal of this checkpoint is to transform your revised outline into a full draft of your *News & Views* article. This is a shorter assignment as you are building directly from your outline, turning it into coherent prose while adhering to the structure and style you’ve developed.

#### Tasks:

1. **Turn Your Outline into Prose:**  
   Using the detailed outline you created and revised in the previous checkpoints, write the first draft of your *News & Views* article. Follow the same structure—Introduction, Summary of Key Findings, Broader Implications, and Conclusion—while developing your ideas fully into sentences and paragraphs.

2. **Keep the Sample in Mind for Length:**  
   Refer back to the sample *News & Views* article provided earlier in the semester to ensure your draft follows a similar length and format. Remember that *News & Views* articles are concise, so aim for clarity and depth without going overboard in length.

3. **Maintain the *News & Views* Style:**  
   As you write, keep your audience in mind—a general, non-specialist reader. Focus on keeping your language clear, engaging, and accessible, while maintaining scientific accuracy and highlighting the significance of the research.

#### Submission and Evaluation:

- **Submission:** Submit your first draft in PDF format. Ensure that your article is well-organized, follows the structure of your outline, and adheres to the length and style of a typical *News & Views* article.
  
- **Evaluation:** Your draft will be evaluated based on how effectively you turned your outline into a full article. The focus will be on the clarity of your writing, how well you explain the key findings and implications, and whether the draft follows the *News & Views* style and format.
