### Objective:
The goal of this checkpoint is to revise your *News & Views* article outline based on the peer feedback you received in Checkpoint 3. This step will help you refine your structure and ensure that your article balances clarity and depth while engaging a general audience.

#### Tasks

1. **Incorporate Peer Feedback:**  
   Review the comments and suggestions provided by your peers on Perusall. Carefully consider their feedback, especially in areas where they highlighted opportunities for improvement. Focus on enhancing clarity, improving how you summarize the key findings, and strengthening the broader implications of the research.
   
   - **Refine Your Introduction:**  
     Adjust your introduction to ensure that it hooks the reader effectively and clearly introduces the broader context of the research. Make sure it sets up the research problem in a way that is engaging for a general, non-expert audience.
   
   - **Clarify the Summary of Key Findings:**  
     Use the peer feedback to refine the summary of the research findings. Ensure that complex ideas are simplified without losing scientific accuracy and that the most interesting or surprising findings are emphasized. Your goal is to make the findings accessible and engaging for a general audience.

   - **Enhance the Broader Implications:**  
     Revise this section by connecting the research more clearly to larger questions or its impact on the field or society, based on peer suggestions. Ensure that future directions or practical applications of the research are clearly stated in an engaging and accessible manner.

   - **Strengthen the Conclusion:**  
     Revise the conclusion to better tie the article together, leaving the reader with a clear understanding of why the research matters. Consider incorporating any forward-looking statements or questions that encourage curiosity, as suggested by your peers.

2. **Maintain the *News & Views* Style:**  
   Ensure that your revised outline continues to emphasize the clarity, accessibility, and engagement required for a *News & Views* article. Balance depth and simplicity, making sure your article remains compelling for a general audience while still reflecting the significance of the research.

#### Submission and Evaluation:

- **Submission:** Submit your revised outline in PDF format. Ensure that each section (Introduction, Summary of Key Findings, Broader Implications, Conclusion) is clearly labeled and that the revisions address the feedback you received.
  
- **Evaluation:** Your revised outline will be evaluated based on how effectively you incorporated peer feedback, improved clarity and engagement, and maintained the overall *News & Views* style. Focus will be on how well your revisions enhance the articleâ€™s accessibility and depth for a non-expert audience.
