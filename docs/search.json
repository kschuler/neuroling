Please read the following guidelines about class participation closely.\nTaking part in a graduate seminar is quite different from attending an undergraduate seminar in terms of its purpose and what is expected of you. As PhD students, you are training to become academics, and are as a result instructors-in-training. You should think of yourself that way in a graduate seminar. You have the responsibility to both listen and contribute because your knowledge and ideas and conclusions to the class are an essential part of the seminar for all participants. The most stimulating seminars are ones in which students come to class informed about the ideas and really engage with each other about them. Please take this responsibility seriously.\nSpecific expectations are that you will:\n\nPrepare for class. Do the reading. All of it. But don’t stop there. Annotate your reading. Ask questions of the text in the margins. Always consider what’s at stake in the reading, how the reading informs your understanding of the class themes, other course materials, the methods, the content. How does the reading relate to your own burgeoning research questions?\nCome to class with questions and discussion points. If you are shy about speaking in class, find a peer to chat with about your thoughts before class. Learning to fully participate in intellectual discussions about ideas is an essential part of becoming an academic, so please use this opportunity to practice this skill.\nDo your part to help foster community. When you attend, please close your other windows and remain engaged in the papers and attentive during the class.\nShowcase your intellectual curiosity by engaging with all types of ideas, not just the ones in your designated area of study. Remain open to positions and ideas that contradict your own. Attempt to fully understand them before contradicting them. Phrases such as, “Can I make sure I understand what you’re saying…?” are very useful.\nDirect your comments to the whole class, not just the instructors.\nUse your breadth of knowledge — connect the readings to other readings in your class and other out-of-class readings. Feel free to apply the readings or theme of the day to your own research, but don’t be so focused on utilitarian knowledge that you fail to engage fully with all of the issues at hand.\nThoughtfully criticize without skewering the reading of the week. This is intellectually lazy. The work must have some redeeming value if the professor has chosen to assign it. Serious critiques of the readings are welcome, but you should attempt to articulate a given reading’s contributions as well as limitations."

    "text": "Reading papers\n\nThe following is an excerpt from a blog post (and now book!) by Barbara Sarneka; Read Step 2: Read the Literature for more info\n\nYou need a systematic way of picking the most important points out of an article or chapter without wasting time. Of course, if you genuinely find the reading pleasurable and you want to read every word, and you have the time to do that, don’t let me stop you. But I’m assuming that you just want to get a basic understanding of what’s been done in your field up to now. To avoid confusion let’s give this activity a different verb: Let’s call it surveying.\nHow to Survey an Empirical Journal Article\nIf you are new to an area, expect to spend 30-60 minutes surveying an empirical article. (Don’t worry; after a few years, you will be able to do it in under 10 minutes.) There are times when surveying isn’t appropriate; for example, when I review a manuscript or a grant proposal, I do feel obligated to read every word. But for the purposes of a literature review, surveying is just fine. You can always come back later and read the details if necessary.\n\nRead the title. Make note of any words you don’t understand, or any questions you have.\nRead the abstract. The abstract is a summary of the whole paper, and it’s worth taking the time to read carefully, several times over if necessary. Again, make note of any questions you have or words you don’t understand.\nScroll through the paper and look at the figures. Figures that illustrate methods or models should give you a good idea of what the researchers did. Figures that illustrate results should show you what the researchers found, and good ones will show you what the researchers’ hypotheses were. Again, make note of any questions you have.\nSkim through the rest of the paper for the answers to your questions. The rest of your reading of this article will be guided by the questions you wrote down in Steps 1-3. With experience, you will be able to find the answers to most questions quickly. Here are some examples of common question types, and where to find the answers.\n\nWhat does [word] mean? Or, what does [abbreviation] stand for? All technical terms and abbreviations should be defined the first time they are used. But sometimes authors break this rule in the title and abstract, where word counts are limited. So look in the introduction for the definition of your mystery word or abbreviation. If you are reading the paper on a screen, you can save time by using the ‘find’ function to search. If the word or abbreviation is not defined in the paper, shame on those authors. You can decide whether to look it up online (but be careful, because scientific terms can be used very differently across different subfields) or just let it go. Personally, I usually let it go. An author who doesn’t bother to define terms isn’t trying very hard to communicate with me, and is not entitled to more of my valuable time and attention.\nWhat question did the authors set out to answer? You can usually find this information in the last paragraph of the introduction. If the information is not there, the authors haven’t organized their introduction properly. Again, you can choose whether to search further or let it go.\nWhat did they measure, and how did they measure it? This information is in the method section, along with information about who the participants were (for experiments with human subjects) and (hopefully) all the other details you would need in order to replicate the study.\nWhat did the authors find? (Not what they think it means.) How did they analyze their data? This information is in the results section.\nWhat do the authors think their findings mean? This information is in the discussion.\n\nWrite a few sentences to a paragraph of notes. The final step in surveying an article is to write a paragraph or so for your own notes, summarizing the authors’ central claim and the main evidence for it. Also note any details that are particularly relevant to your work. For example, if the study used a design or an analysis that you might use, make a note of it."

    "text": "Syllabus\nCourse Description: Neurolinguistics is a seminar on language and the brain. For the first few weeks, you will build a foundation of knowledge, first on how brains work (neurons, networks, and anatomy) and later on the methods researchers use to study language in the brain. The remainder of the course will explore the literature on different topics in language and the brain, including various levels of linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax), acquisition, evolution, signed languages, and more.\nPrerequisites: This course is open to all graduate students and upper-level undergraduates. No specific background in neuroscience or linguistics is necessary to participate in the course. However, this is an advanced seminar-style course; students looking for a lecture formart will not enjoy this course.\nInstructor: Dr. Katie Schuler (she/her)\n\nYou can call me Katie\n\nSeminars: Thursday at 1:45pm in TBD\nOffice Hours: The linguistics department is located on the 3rd floor of 3401-C Walnut street, between Franklin’s Table and Modern Eye.\n\nKatie Schuler: TBD in 314C\n\nRequirements: This is an advanced STEM seminar. Below are the major requiements, but please read the tips for seminars to understand further:\n\nReading prep: Each week, you will be responsible for preparing for the discussion by completing the assigned reading. As you read, you are responsible for asking questions and beginning the discussion of the paper in our reading annotation tool, Perusall keeping a reading log including a brief summary of main points, your critical reflections, and a few discussion questions for class.\nDiscussion leader: Several times throughout the semester (but not every week), you will serve as discussion leader for a paper with one or two other students. As discussion leader, your group will be responsible for presenting the paper, including summarizing (motivation, research questions, approach, and findings) and leading a discussion of the work.\nFinal paper: You will select a paper of interest to you (within the bounds of language and the brain) and write a research analysis of the work (in the form of a nature “News & Views” paper; example here). There are a few checkpoints leading up to this final paper (including peer review) to help you make progress.\n\nGrading:\n\n30% Participation in discussion (including reading prep in Perusall via your reading log)\n40% Discussion leader\n30% Final paper (including several check-points throughout the semester: paper selection, outline, drafts, and peer review)\n\nExtensions: For assignments related to the final paper, extensions of up to 1 week will be granted for any reason. Beyond that, you can turn in any missed writing assignement for half-credit (50%).\nAccomodations: I will support any accommodations arranged through Disability Services via the Weingarten Center and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify me as soon as possible if you require accomodations.\nExtra credit: There is no extra credit in the course. However, students can submit any missed reading prep by the end of the semester for half credit (50%). To ensure fair treatment, all students will receive a 1% “bonus” to their final course grade: 92.54% will become 93.54%.\nSupport: Asking for help is a sign of strength! I hope you’ll reach out to me if you need help (acamdeically or otherwise). I also want you to be aware of Penn’s Academic & Wellness Resources",

    "title": "Checkpoint 2: Outline",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Objective\nThe goal of this checkpoint is to help you decide which paper you will write about and create a detailed outline of your News & Views article.\n\n\nTasks\n\nSelect One Paper: From the three papers you previously chose, select the one you will focus on for your final News & Views article. Consider which paper has the most compelling findings or broader implications, which is most interesting to you, and which one you feel confident about explaining clearly to a general audience.\nCreate an Outline: Your outline should break down the structure of your News & Views article, guiding you through the main points you’ll need to cover. Use the following structure:\n\nIntroduction: Briefly introduce the broader topic or context. Explain why this research is important in a way that would catch the attention of a general, non-specialist audience. Set up the key question or problem that the paper addresses.\nSummary of Key Findings: Summarize the research paper’s main findings clearly and concisely. Make sure your summary simplifies complex ideas without oversimplifying the science. Highlight the most interesting or surprising aspects of the research. Aim to avoid jargon and ensure that a general audience can follow along.\nBroader Implications: Connect the research to a larger context. How does this study affect the field or even society at large? Mention any questions this research raises for future work or practical applications. Be sure to keep the tone accessible but insightful—this is where you can really engage readers with the broader significance.\nConclusion: Wrap up the article by reflecting on the importance of the research. Leave the reader with a sense of why this research matters in the bigger picture. You could include a forward-looking statement, such as potential future developments or questions left to be answered.\n\nEmphasizing News & Views Style:\n\nClarity: Your outline should show how you plan to write in a clear and engaging way for non-experts. Avoid heavy technical details, but don’t shy away from highlighting exciting or impactful aspects of the work.\nBalanced Depth: While writing for accessibility, also maintain depth by emphasizing the research’s significance and the connections to bigger questions.\nEngagement: Think about how to keep readers interested throughout. You might include a surprising fact, real-world relevance, or something to spark curiosity.\n\n\n\n\nSubmission and evaluation\n\nSubmission : Submit your completed outline in PDF format. Ensure that each section (Introduction, Summary, Broader Implications, Conclusion) is clearly labeled.\nEvaluation: In checkpoint 3, your peers will review your outline with the following in mind:\n\nHave you chosen a paper that has both interesting findings and broader significance?\nDoes the outline of your introduction show how you will hook a general audience while introducing the research?\nDoes your outline indicate a clear and concise summary of findings, with complex ideas simplified?\nDoes you outline include how you will highlight the broader implications effectively?\nDoes the outline of your conclusion tie everything together and leave the reader with a sense of importance?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Objective:\nThe goal of this checkpoint is to provide constructive feedback on three of your peers’ outlines from Checkpoint 2. You will assess their paper selection and the structure of their proposed News & Views articles, focusing on how well they plan to engage a general audience while maintaining scientific depth.\n\n\nTasks:\n\nEvaluate Paper Selection (for each outline):\nReview whether the author has chosen a paper with compelling findings and broader significance. Consider if the selected paper presents interesting implications for the field or society at large. Additionally, evaluate whether the chosen paper can be explained clearly to a general audience without losing important scientific details.\nAssess the Introduction (for each outline):\nExamine if the introduction effectively hooks the reader by explaining the broader context in an engaging way. Assess whether the introduction sets up the research problem or question clearly for a non-expert audience, and provide feedback on how well it balances accessibility with depth.\nReview the Summary of Key Findings (for each outline):\nEvaluate whether the outline presents a concise and clear summary of the research findings. Check if complex ideas are simplified without oversimplifying the science and whether the most interesting or surprising findings are highlighted. Suggest improvements for making the findings more engaging or clearer for a general audience.\nEvaluate Broader Implications (for each outline):\nAssess how well the outline explains the connection of the research to larger questions or its broader impact on the field or society. Determine if the author mentions any potential future work or practical applications, and provide feedback on how effectively the outline engages readers with the research’s significance.\nAssess the Conclusion (for each outline):\nDetermine if the conclusion effectively ties together the article’s main points and leaves the reader with a sense of why the research matters. Check if the conclusion includes a forward-looking statement that encourages curiosity about future developments, and suggest improvements to make the conclusion more compelling and reflective of the article’s key messages.\nEvaluate the Emphasis on News & Views Style (for each outline):\nEvaluate the clarity of the outline, focusing on whether it shows a plan to write clearly and engage non-experts. Check if the outline maintains a good balance between accessibility and depth, and whether the article can keep readers engaged. Suggest ways to make the outline more engaging, such as including surprising facts, real-world relevance, or thought-provoking questions.\nAI Use:* Evaluate whether the outline is primarily human-written or if AI was used appropriately as a writing partner. If the outline feels original and personal, with AI perhaps assisting in structure or grammar, score it highly. If it seems overly formal, generic, or disconnected from the student’s own voice, it may be mostly AI-generated.\n\n\n\nSubmission and Evaluation:\n\nSubmission: Use Perusall to review and comment on the three outlines you have been assigned. As you read through each outline, add specific comments and suggestions directly on the document. Ensure your comments cover each section (Introduction, Summary of Key Findings, Broader Implications, Conclusion) as well as the overall engagement and News & Views style.\nEvaluation: Your peers will use your comments to revise their outlines for their News & Views articles. Focus on whether they are meeting the dual goals of clarity and depth, and if their outlines show a clear plan for engaging a non-expert audience."

This type of article communicates the significance and context of a research paper to a broader audience, highlighting its key findings and implications.\nAnalyze the Structure: As you read, think about these questions:\n\nWhat is the main goal of a News & Views article?\nHow does the author introduce the topic and summarize the research?\nWhat aspects of the research are emphasized, and how are they connected to broader implications?\nHow does the author simplify the complex ideas for non-experts while still maintaining depth and insight?\nWhat is the overall structure (e.g., introduction, summary of findings, broader context, conclusion)?\n\nWrite a Short Reflection: After reading the sample article, write a brief (250-300 word) reflection on what you learned about the structure and purpose of a Nature News & Views article. Focus on how the author balances accessibility with depth, and how they present the research to a general audience.\n\n\n\nPart 2: Paper Selection\nNow that you have a better understanding of how research is communicated in a News & Views format, it’s time to begin considering papers for your final project.\n\nSelect Three Papers: Identify three academic papers, articles, or research papers that you might want to analyze and write about in your final News & Views-style assignment.\nProvide Brief Notes on Each:\n\nSummary: Write a brief 2-3 sentence summary of the paper’s main argument or findings.\nPros: Why are you interested in this paper? Does it align well with the course themes, provide strong evidence, or offer an interesting perspective?\nCons: What are some potential challenges with using this paper? Is there limited data, narrow scope, or another reason it might be less suitable?\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmission and Evaluation\n\nSubmit a PDF that includes:\n\nYour reflection on the Nature News & Views article.\nYour three selected papers with notes on each (summary, pros, cons).\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nReflection on Structure: Does your reflection show a clear understanding of the Nature News & Views format?\nPaper Selection: Have you thoughtfully considered the relevance and potential challenges of each selected paper?"
