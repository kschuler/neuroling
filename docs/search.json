Please read the following guidelines about class participation closely.\nTaking part in a graduate seminar is quite different from attending an undergraduate seminar in terms of its purpose and what is expected of you. As PhD students, you are training to become academics, and are as a result instructors-in-training. You should think of yourself that way in a graduate seminar. You have the responsibility to both listen and contribute because your knowledge and ideas and conclusions to the class are an essential part of the seminar for all participants. The most stimulating seminars are ones in which students come to class informed about the ideas and really engage with each other about them. Please take this responsibility seriously.\nSpecific expectations are that you will:\n\nPrepare for class. Do the reading. All of it. But don’t stop there. Annotate your reading. Ask questions of the text in the margins. Always consider what’s at stake in the reading, how the reading informs your understanding of the class themes, other course materials, the methods, the content. How does the reading relate to your own burgeoning research questions?\nCome to class with questions and discussion points. If you are shy about speaking in class, find a peer to chat with about your thoughts before class. Learning to fully participate in intellectual discussions about ideas is an essential part of becoming an academic, so please use this opportunity to practice this skill.\nDo your part to help foster community. When you attend, please close your other windows and remain engaged in the papers and attentive during the class.\nShowcase your intellectual curiosity by engaging with all types of ideas, not just the ones in your designated area of study. Remain open to positions and ideas that contradict your own. Attempt to fully understand them before contradicting them. Phrases such as, “Can I make sure I understand what you’re saying…?” are very useful.\nDirect your comments to the whole class, not just the instructors.\nUse your breadth of knowledge — connect the readings to other readings in your class and other out-of-class readings. Feel free to apply the readings or theme of the day to your own research, but don’t be so focused on utilitarian knowledge that you fail to engage fully with all of the issues at hand.\nThoughtfully criticize without skewering the reading of the week. This is intellectually lazy. The work must have some redeeming value if the professor has chosen to assign it. Serious critiques of the readings are welcome, but you should attempt to articulate a given reading’s contributions as well as limitations."

    "text": "Reading papers\n\nThe following is an excerpt from a blog post (and now book!) by Barbara Sarneka; Read Step 2: Read the Literature for more info\n\nYou need a systematic way of picking the most important points out of an article or chapter without wasting time. Of course, if you genuinely find the reading pleasurable and you want to read every word, and you have the time to do that, don’t let me stop you. But I’m assuming that you just want to get a basic understanding of what’s been done in your field up to now. To avoid confusion let’s give this activity a different verb: Let’s call it surveying.\nHow to Survey an Empirical Journal Article\nIf you are new to an area, expect to spend 30-60 minutes surveying an empirical article. (Don’t worry; after a few years, you will be able to do it in under 10 minutes.) There are times when surveying isn’t appropriate; for example, when I review a manuscript or a grant proposal, I do feel obligated to read every word. But for the purposes of a literature review, surveying is just fine. You can always come back later and read the details if necessary.\n\nRead the title. Make note of any words you don’t understand, or any questions you have.\nRead the abstract. The abstract is a summary of the whole paper, and it’s worth taking the time to read carefully, several times over if necessary. Again, make note of any questions you have or words you don’t understand.\nScroll through the paper and look at the figures. Figures that illustrate methods or models should give you a good idea of what the researchers did. Figures that illustrate results should show you what the researchers found, and good ones will show you what the researchers’ hypotheses were. Again, make note of any questions you have.\nSkim through the rest of the paper for the answers to your questions. The rest of your reading of this article will be guided by the questions you wrote down in Steps 1-3. With experience, you will be able to find the answers to most questions quickly. Here are some examples of common question types, and where to find the answers.\n\nWhat does [word] mean? Or, what does [abbreviation] stand for? All technical terms and abbreviations should be defined the first time they are used. But sometimes authors break this rule in the title and abstract, where word counts are limited. So look in the introduction for the definition of your mystery word or abbreviation. If you are reading the paper on a screen, you can save time by using the ‘find’ function to search. If the word or abbreviation is not defined in the paper, shame on those authors. You can decide whether to look it up online (but be careful, because scientific terms can be used very differently across different subfields) or just let it go. Personally, I usually let it go. An author who doesn’t bother to define terms isn’t trying very hard to communicate with me, and is not entitled to more of my valuable time and attention.\nWhat question did the authors set out to answer? You can usually find this information in the last paragraph of the introduction. If the information is not there, the authors haven’t organized their introduction properly. Again, you can choose whether to search further or let it go.\nWhat did they measure, and how did they measure it? This information is in the method section, along with information about who the participants were (for experiments with human subjects) and (hopefully) all the other details you would need in order to replicate the study.\nWhat did the authors find? (Not what they think it means.) How did they analyze their data? This information is in the results section.\nWhat do the authors think their findings mean? This information is in the discussion.\n\nWrite a few sentences to a paragraph of notes. The final step in surveying an article is to write a paragraph or so for your own notes, summarizing the authors’ central claim and the main evidence for it. Also note any details that are particularly relevant to your work. For example, if the study used a design or an analysis that you might use, make a note of it."

    "text": "Syllabus\nCourse Description: Neurolinguistics is a seminar on language and the brain. For the first few weeks, you will build a foundation of knowledge, first on how brains work (neurons, networks, and anatomy) and later on the methods researchers use to study language in the brain. The remainder of the course will explore the literature on different topics in language and the brain, including various levels of linguistics (phonology, morphology, syntax), acquisition, evolution, signed languages, and more.\nPrerequisites: This course is open to all graduate students and upper-level undergraduates. No specific background in neuroscience or linguistics is necessary to participate in the course. However, this is an advanced seminar-style course; students looking for a lecture formart will not enjoy this course.\nInstructor: Dr. Katie Schuler (she/her)\n\nYou can call me Katie\n\nSeminars: Thursday at 1:45pm in TBD\nOffice Hours: The linguistics department is located on the 3rd floor of 3401-C Walnut street, between Franklin’s Table and Modern Eye.\n\nKatie Schuler: TBD in 314C\n\nRequirements: This is an advanced STEM seminar. Below are the major requiements, but please read the tips for seminars to understand further:\n\nReading prep: Each week, you will be responsible for preparing for the discussion by completing the assigned reading. As you read, you are responsible for asking questions and beginning the discussion of the paper in our reading annotation tool, Perusall.\nDiscussion leader: Several times throughout the semester (but not every week), you will serve as discussion leader for a paper with one or two other students. As discussion leader, your group will be responsible for presenting the paper, including summarizing (motivation, research questions, approach, and findings) and leading a discussion of the work.\nFinal paper: You will select a paper of interest to you (within the bounds of language and the brain) and write a research analysis of the work (in the form of a nature “News & Views” paper; example here). There are a few checkpoints leading up to this final paper (including peer review) to help you make progress.\n\nGrading:\n\n30% Participation in discussion (including reading prep in Perusall)\n40% Discussion leader\n30% Final paper (including several check-points throughout the semester: paper selection, outline, drafts, and peer review)\n\nAccomodations: I will support any accommodations arranged through Disability Services via the Weingarten Center and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify me as soon as possible if you require accomodations.\nExtra credit: There is no extra credit in the course. However, students can submit any missed reading prep by the end of the semester for half credit (50%). To ensure fair treatment, all students will receive a 1% “bonus” to their final course grade: 92.54% will become 93.54%.\nSupport: Asking for help is a sign of strength! I hope you’ll reach out to me if you need help (acamdeically or otherwise). I also want you to be aware of Penn’s Academic & Wellness Resources",
